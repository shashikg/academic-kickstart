# About Me

I'm an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/). I'm also exploring the field of **Cognitive Science** and is registered in a minor program in that department. My interest lie in **Signal Processing**, **Human Cognition** and **Computer Vision**, with a dream of building an artificial agent which can mimic **humans!!**

Apart from academic interests, I love to do **pencil sketching**, **kirigami**, wasting my time watching **animes** and (Spending time alone absolutely thinking nothing..   :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: )
